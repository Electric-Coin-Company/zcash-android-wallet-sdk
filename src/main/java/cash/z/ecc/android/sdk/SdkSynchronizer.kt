/**
 * A Synchronizer that attempts to remain operational, despite any number of errors that can occur.
 * It acts as the glue that ties all the pieces of the SDK together. Each component of the SDK is
 * designed for the potential of stand-alone usage but coordinating all the interactions is non-
 * trivial. So the Synchronizer facilitates this, acting as reference that demonstrates how all the
 * pieces can be tied together. Its goal is to allow a developer to focus on their app rather than
 * the nuances of how Zcash works.
 *
 * @property storage exposes flows of wallet transaction information.
 * @property txManager manages and tracks outbound transactions.
 * @property processor saves the downloaded compact blocks to the cache and then scans those blocks for
 * data related to this wallet.

/**
 * Builder function for constructing a Synchronizer with flexibility for adding custom behavior. The
 * Initializer is the only thing required because it takes care of loading the Rust libraries
 * properly; everything else has a reasonable default. For a wallet, the most common flow is to
 * first call either [Initializer.new] or [Initializer.import] on the first run and then
 * [Initializer.open] for all subsequent launches of the wallet. From there, the initializer is
 * passed to this function in order to start syncing from where the wallet left off.
 *
 * The remaining parameters are all optional and they allow a wallet maker to customize any
 * subcomponent of the Synchronizer. For example, this function could be used to inject an in-memory
 * CompactBlockStore rather than a SQL implementation or a downloader that does not use gRPC:
 *
 * ```
 * val initializer = Initializer(context, host, port).import(seedPhrase, birthdayHeight)
 * val synchronizer = Synchronizer(initializer,
 *      blockStore = MyInMemoryBlockStore(),
 *      downloader = MyRestfulServiceForBlocks()
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * Note: alternatively, all the objects required to build a Synchronizer (the object graph) can be
 * supplied by a dependency injection framework like Dagger or Koin. This builder just makes that
 * process a bit easier so developers can get started syncing the blockchain without the overhead of
 * configuring a bunch of objects, first.
 *
 * @param initializer the helper that is leveraged for creating all the components that the
 * Synchronizer requires. It contains all information necessary to build a synchronizer and it is
 * mainly responsible for initializing the databases associated with this synchronizer and loading
 * the rust backend.
 * @param repository repository of wallet data, providing an interface to the underlying info.
 * @param blockStore component responsible for storing compact blocks downloaded from lightwalletd.
 * @param service the lightwalletd service that can provide compact blocks and submit transactions.
 * @param encoder the component responsible for encoding transactions.
 * @param downloader the component responsible for downloading ranges of compact blocks.
 * @param txManager the component that manages outbound transactions in order to report which ones are
 * still pending, particularly after failed attempts or dropped connectivity. The intent is to help
 * monitor outbound transactions status through to completion.
 * @param processor the component responsible for processing compact blocks. This is effectively the
 * brains of the synchronizer that implements most of the high-level business logic and determines
 * the current state of the wallet.
