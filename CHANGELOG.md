# Changelog
All notable changes to this library will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this library adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.3.0] - 2025-07-28

### Added
- [WalletCoordinator] now takes [isTorEnabled] as a constructor parameter.
  - When set to `true`, lightwalletd RPC queries will be made over Tor (where possible and beneficial).
  - When set to `false`, lightwalletd RPC queries will always be made directly to the server.
- [Synchronizer] now exposes [initializationError] property containing synchronizer errors that happened during 
  synchronizer init

### Fixed
- Tor client is now optional in case it's instantiation fails to prevent SDK

## [2.2.15] - 2025-06-26

### Fixed
- Tor client is now optional in case it's instantiation fails to prevent SDK from crashing

## [2.2.14] - 2025-06-16

## Fixed
- FFI 0.17.0 introduces retry logic for Tor, significantly improving the reliability of currency conversion fetches.

### Changed
- Added a `ServiceOption` parameter for functions `WalletClient.getServerInfo`, `WalletClient.getLatestBlockHeight`, 
  `WalletClient.fetchTransaction`, `WalletClient.submitTransaction` and `WalletClient.getTreeState` to add the 
  option to execute over Tor. Custom lightwalletd servers over VPNs like Tailscape might stop working when using Tor.
- `Synchronizer.getFastestServers` function signature changed and does not require `Context` parameter anymore

## [2.2.13] - 2025-05-16

### Added
- `Synchronizer.getCustomUnifiedAddress` allows the caller to obtain a newly-generated
  unified address with user-specified `UnifiedAddressRequest` of type `P2PKH`, `Sapling` and `Orchard` supporting 
  the ability to combine these using an infix `and` function.

## [2.2.12] - 2025-04-28

### Added
- `Synchronizer.areFundsSpendable` that indicates whether are the shielded wallet balances spendable or not during 
  the block synchronization process.
- `SdkSynchronizer.estimateBirthdayHeight(date: Date)` has been added to get an estimated height for a given date, 
  typically used for estimating birthday.

### Changed
- The base sapling params download URL has been changed to `https://download.z.cash/downloads/`
- Checkpoints update

### Fixed
- As part of the sapling params download URL change, the extra `/` character has been removed from the result path

## [2.2.11] - 2025-04-04

### Fixed
- Database migration bugs in `zcash_client_sqlite 0.16.0` and `0.16.1` have
  been fixed by updating to `zcash_client_sqlite 0.16.2`. These caused a few
  wallets to stop working after the 2.2.9 upgrade due to failed database
  migrations.

## [2.2.9] - 2025-03-25

  - Kotlin 2.1.10
  - Bip39 1.0.9
  - Other dependencies update
- Migrated to `zcash_client_backend 0.18.0`, `zcash_client_sqlite 0.16.0`
- Added support for gap-limit-based discovery of transparent wallet addresses.
- The internal `fetch-utxos` logic is now triggered only in every `init` and `complete` block sync phases, and it 
  fetches UTXOs from height 0 to support the Ledger funds rescue requirement.
- Checkpoints update

## [2.2.8] - 2025-03-03

### Added
- `AccountMetadataKey`
- `DerivationTool.deriveAccountMetadataKey`
- `DerivationTool.derivePrivateUseMetadataKey`
- `Synchronizer.getTransactionsByMemoSubstring()` has been added
- `Synchronizer.redactPcztForSigner`

  `PendingTransaction` model classes
- `TransactionOverview.totalSpent` and `TransactionOverview.totalReceived` properties added to provide more 
  information about shielding transaction

### Changed
- Migrated to Rust 1.84.1.
- `Synchronizer.getTransactions(accountUuid)` and `Synchronizer.transactions` now internally fill in 
  `TransactionOverview.blockTimeEpochSeconds` based on the related block time 
- `Synchronizer.transactions` has been renamed to `Synchronizer.allTransactions` to emphasize the fact the API 
  returns transactions for all the wallet accounts
- `Synchronizer.getRecipients` now returns both address and an account existing in database

## [2.2.7] - 2024-12-18

### Added
- `Synchronizer.importAccountByUfvk()` has been added
- `Synchronizer.getAccounts()` returning all the created or imported accounts. See the documentation in `Account`.

- `Synchronizer.createPcztFromProposal`
- `Synchronizer.addProofsToPczt`
- `Synchronizer.createTransactionFromPczt`
- `Zip32AccountIndex`, `AccountUuid`, `AccountUsk`, `AccountPurpose`, `AccountCreateSetup`, `AcountImportSetup`, and 
  `Pczt` model classes have been added to support the new or the changed APIs

### Changed
- `Account` data class works with `accountUuid: AccountUuid` instead of the previous ZIP 32 account index
- These functions from `DerivationTool` have been refactored to work with the new `Zip32AccountIndex` instead of the
  `Account` data class: `deriveUnifiedSpendingKey`, `deriveUnifiedAddress`, `deriveArbitraryAccountKey`
- `WalletCoordinator` now provides a way to instantiate `Synchronizer` with the new `accountName` and `keySource` 
  parameters
- `UnifiedSpendingKey` does not hold `Account` information anymore, it has been replaced by `AccountUsk` model class 
  in a few internal cases
- `Synchronizer.send` extension function receives `Account` on input
- `PendingTransaction` sealed class descendants have been renamed
- `RustLayerException.GetCurrentAddressException` has been renamed to `RustLayerException.GetAddressException`
- Checkpoints update

### Removed
- `Synchronizer.sendToAddress` and `Synchronizer.shieldFunds` have been removed, use 
  `Synchronizer.createProposedTransactions` and `Synchronizer.proposeShielding` instead
- `Synchronizer.orchardBalances`, `Synchronizer.saplingBalances`, and `Synchronizer.transparentBalance`
  (use `Synchronizer.walletBalances` instead).

### Fixed
- The `CompactBlockProcessor` now correctly distinguishes between `Response.Failure.Server.Unavailable` and other 
  errors in its `refreshUtxos` API. It then sets its state to `State.Disconnected` in such a case.

## [2.2.6] - 2024-11-16

### Added
- `DerivationTool.deriveArbitraryWalletKey`
- `DerivationTool.deriveArbitraryAccountKey`
- `Synchronizer.getTransactionOutputs` API has been added. It enables to fetch all transaction outputs from database.

## [2.2.5] - 2024-10-22

### Added
- The new `Synchronizer.proposeFulfillingPaymentUri` API has been added. It enables constructing Proposal object from 
  the given ZIP-321 Uri, and then creating transactions from it.

### Changed
- Migrated to Rust 1.82.0.
- `Synchronizer.rewindToNearestHeight` now returns the block height that was
  actually rewound to, or `null` if no rewind was performed.
- `Synchronizer.proposeTransfer` throws `TransactionEncoderException.ProposalFromParametersException`
- `Synchronizer.proposeShielding` throws `TransactionEncoderException.ProposalShieldingException`
- `Synchronizer.createProposedTransactions` throws `TransactionEncoderException.TransactionNotCreatedException` and `TransactionEncoderException.TransactionNotFoundException`
- `LightWalletClient` now implements `Closeable` and is thus correctly cleaned up in `SdkSynchronizer` and
  `FastestServerFetcher` after it's used
- Checkpoints update

### Fixed
- `FailedSynchronizationException` reported using `Synchronizer.onProcessorErrorHandler` now contains the full 
  stacktrace history

### Removed
- `Synchronizer.getNearestRewindHeight` (its function is now handled internally
  by `Synchronizer.rewindToNearestHeight`).
- `Synchronizer.quickRewind` and `CompactBlockProcessor.quickRewind` have been removed as they triggered the block 
  rewind action at an invalid height. Use `Synchronizer.rewindToNearestHeight` instead.

## [2.2.4] - 2024-09-16

### Added
- `TransactionOverview.isShielding` has been added to indicate the shielding transaction type

### Changed
- NDK version has been updated to `27.0.12077973`
- Android `compileSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` has been updated to 35
- `CompackBlockProcessor.calculatePollInterval` now uses a randomized poll interval to avoid exposing computation time

### Fixed
- Android 15 (SDK level 35) support added for 16 KB memory page size
- The broken disposing logic `TorClient.freeTorRuntime` for Android SDK API level 27 has been fixed

## [2.2.3] - 2024-09-09

### Changed
- Several functions have been updated to accept `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.model.Locale` instead of
  `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.model.MonetarySeparators` as an argument. MonetarySeparators are derived from Locale now.
- `FiatCurrencyConversion.toZatoshi`
- `Zatoshi.toFiatCurrencyState`
- `Zatoshi.toFiatString`
- `BigDecimal.convertFiatDecimalToFiatString`
- `Zatoshi.Companion.fromZecString`

### Added
- `Double?.convertUsdToZec` has been added as we are moving away from `BigDecimal` in favor of primitive types
- `Locale.getDefault()` has been added
- Transaction resubmission feature has been added to the CompactBlockProcessor's regular actions. This new action
  periodically checks unmined sent transactions that are still within their expiry window and resubmits them if
  there are any.

### Fixed
- Fastest Server calculation changed for estimated height

## [2.2.2] - 2024-09-03

### Fixed
- Migrated to `zcash_client_sqlite 0.11.2` to remove use of a database feature
  that prevented use of Zashi on older devices.

### Changed
- Checkpoints update

## [2.2.1] - 2024-08-22

### Fixed
- A database migration misconfiguration that could result in problems with wallet
  initialization was fixed.

## [2.2.0] - 2024-08-22

This release adds several important new features:
- Currency exchange rates (currently just USD/ZEC) are now made available via the SDK.
  The exchange rate computed as the median of values provided by at least three separate
  cryptocurrency exchanges, and is fetched over Tor connections in order to avoid leaking
  the wallet's IP address to the exchanges.
- Sending to ZIP 320 (TEX) addresses is now supported. When sending to a ZIP 320 address,
  the wallet will first automatically de-shield the required funds to a fresh ephemeral 
  transparent address, and then will make a second fully-transparent transaction sending
  the funds to the eventual recipient that is not linkable via on-chain information to any 
  other transaction in the  user's wallet.
- As part of adding ZIP 320 support, the SDK now also provides full support for recovering
  transparent transaction history. Prior to this release, only transactions belonging to the
  wallet that contained either some shielded component OR a member of the current
  transparent UTXO set were included in transaction history.

### Changed
- Migrated to Rust 1.80.0.
- `Synchronizer.proposeTransfer` now supports TEX addresses (ZIP 320).
- Internal transactions-enhancing logic has changed to support the history of transactions made to TEX addresses 

### Added
- `Synchronizer.isValidTexAddr` which checks whether the given address is a valid ZIP 320 TEX address
- `Synchronizer.exchangeRateUsd` is a `StateFlow` containing the latest USD/ZEC
  exchange rate, along with the `Instant` it was fetched. It can be initialized
  and refreshed by calling `Synchronizer.refreshExchangeRateUsd()`.
- `ZatoshiExt.toFiatString` is now a public function
- `Synchronizer.getFastestServers([LightWalletEndpoint])` is a flow that measures connections to given endpoints and
  returns the three fastest ones
- `Synchronizer.getTAddressTransactions` returns all the transactions for a given t-address over the given range

### Changed
- Checkpoints update

## [2.1.3] - 2024-08-08

### Changed
- The fetch UTXOs action is now hooked up at the beginning of every scanning phase of the block synchronization logic 
  instead of being called every 1000 blocks together with shielded transactions enhancing. It uses 
  `fullyScannedHeight` as its lower bound.
- The fetch UTXOs action reports `FetchUtxosException` to the wrapping `onProcessorErrorHandler` or 
  `onCriticalErrorHandler` in case any error occurs 
- The internal `CompactBlockProcessor.SYNC_BATCH_SIZE` has changed. Block synchronization logic now works above 
  batch of blocks with size 1000 blocks instead of just 100 blocks, except the Zcash sandblasting period in which 
  batch size of 100 blocks is still used.
- The internal `FileCompactBlockRepository.BLOCKS_METADATA_BUFFER_SIZE` constant has been raised from 10 to 1000 to 
  match the block synchronization batch size. 
- The overall speed-up of the entire block synchronization logic, thanks to the both mentioned synchronization 
  improvements above is about 50% out of the Zcash sandblasting period. There is still some improvement in the 
  sandblasting period.
- Checkpoints update

### Fixed
- `Synchronizer.refreshUtxos(account: Account, since: BlockHeight)` now correctly uses the `since` parameter in the 
  underlying logic and fetches UTXOs from that height

## [2.1.2] - 2024-07-16

### Added
- `SdkSynchronizer.closeFlow()` is a Flow-providing version of `Synchronizer.close()`. It safely closes the 
  Synchronizer together with the related components.
- `WalletCoordinator.deleteSdkDataFlow` is a Flow-providing function that deletes all the persisted data in the SDK 
  (databases associated with the wallet, all compact blocks, and data derived from those blocks) but preserves the 
  wallet secrets.

### Changed
- The Android SDK target API level has been updated to version 34
- `ZecString` and `Zatoshi` APIs now handle `MonetarySeparators` with the same grouping and decimal characters
- Checkpoints update

### Fixed
- `MonetarySeparators` API does not signal an unsupported state to clients if used on a device with Locale with the 
 same decimal and grouping separators. Instead, it will just omit the grouping separator.

## [2.1.1] - 2024-04-23

### Changed
- The SDK components no longer contain logging statements in the release build
- `safelyConvertToBigDecimal()` API from `CurrencyFormatter.kt` now expects decimal separator Char on input
- Gradle 8.7
- Android Gradle Plugin 8.3.0
- Kotlin 1.9.23
- Other dependencies update
- Checkpoints update

## [2.1.0] - 2024-04-09

### Added
- The Orchard support has been finished, and the SDK now fully supports sending and receiving funds on the Orchard 
  addresses

### Fixed
- SDK release 1.11.0-beta01 documented that `Synchronizer.new` would throw an
  exception indicating that an internal migration requires the wallet seed, if
  called with `null`. This has been unintentionally broken the entire time: the
  handling logic for this case was accidentally removed shortly after it was
  added. The SDK now correctly throws `InitializeException.SeedRequired`.

### Changed
- `Synchronizer.refreshAllBalances` now refreshes the Orchard balances as well
- The SDK uses ZIP-317 fee system internally
- `ZcashSdk.MINERS_FEE` has been deprecated, and will be removed in 2.1.x
- `ZecSend` data class now provides `Proposal?` object initiated using `Synchronizer.proposeTransfer`
- Wallet initialization using `Synchronizer.new` now could throw a new `SeedNotRelevant` exception when the provided 
  seed is not relevant to any of the derived accounts in the wallet database
- Checkpoints update

## [2.0.7] - 2024-03-08

### Fixed
- `Synchronizer.sendToAddress` and `Synchronizer.shieldFunds` now throw an
  exception if the created transaction successfully reaches `lightwalletd` but
  fails to reach its backing full node's mempool.

### Changed
- `WalletBalance` now contains new fields `changePending` and `valuePending`. Fields `total` and `pending` are 
  still provided. See more in the class documentation 
  `sdk-lib/src/main/java/cash/z/ecc/android/sdk/model/WalletBalance.kt`
- `Synchronizer.transparentBalances: WalletBalance` to `Synchronizer.transparentBalance: Zatoshi`
- `WalletSnapshot.transparentBalance: WalletBalance` to `WalletSnapshot.transparentBalance: Zatoshi`
- `Memo.MAX_MEMO_LENGTH_BYTES` is now available in public API
- `Synchronizer.sendToAddress` and `Synchronizer.shieldFunds` have been
  deprecated, and will be removed in 2.1.x (which will create multiple
  transactions at once for some recipients).

### Added
- APIs that enable constructing a proposal for transferring or shielding funds,
  and then creating transactions from a proposal. The intermediate proposal can
  be used to determine the required fee, before committing to producing
  transactions.
  - `Synchronizer.proposeTransfer`
  - `Synchronizer.proposeShielding`
  - `Synchronizer.createProposedTransactions`
- `WalletBalanceFixture` class with mock values that are supposed to be used only for testing purposes 
- `Memo.countLength(memoString: String)` to count memo length in bytes
- `PersistableWallet.toSafeString` is a safe alternative for the regular [toString] function that prints only 
  non-sensitive parts
- `Synchronizer.validateServerEndpoint` this function checks whether the provided server endpoint is valid. 
  The validation is based on comparing:
  * network type
  * sapling activation height
  * consensus branch id

## [2.0.6] - 2024-01-30

### Fixed
- In 2.0.5, `Synchronizer.shieldFunds` always returned an error due to a crash
  on the Rust side. This release fixes the underlying bug.

## [2.0.5] - 2024-01-30

### Added
- `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.model.Proposal` (currently unused in the public API).
- System tracing to `CompactBlockProcessor` and the Rust backend.

### Changed
- Migrated to NDK 26.1.10909125 and Rust 1.75.0.
- The wallet balances are now updated immediately upon synchronizer start.
- Existing wallets will now only fetch the most recent subtree roots, improving
  synchronizer startup times.
- Performance of block scanning and `SdkSynchronizer.refreshAllBalances` has
  been improved.
- `WalletAddressFixture` fixture properties have been updated

### Fixed
- The transparent wallet balance `StateFlow` now shows the total transparent
  balance in the wallet, instead of the balance of the default address. It also
  now treats all zero-conf balance as available.

### Removed
- `SdkSynchronizer.refreshSaplingBalance` and
  `SdkSynchronizer.refreshTransparentBalance`
  (use `SdkSynchronizer.refreshAllBalances` instead).

## [2.0.4] - 2024-01-08

### Added
- `TransactionOverview.txIdString()` to provide a readable transaction ID to SDK-consuming apps
- `MonetarySeparators.current(locale: Locale? = null)` now accepts `Locale` on input to force separators locale. If 
  no value is provided, the default one is used. 

### Removed
- `LightWalletEndpointExt` and its functions and variables were removed from the SDK's public APIs entirely. It's 
  preserved only for testing and wallet Demo app purposes. The calling wallet app should provide its own 
  `LightWalletEndpoint` instance within `PersistableWallet` or `SdkSynchronizer` APIs.

### Changed
- Gradle 8.5
- Kotlin 1.9.21
- Other dependency update
- Checkpoints update

### Removed
- Several internally unused exceptions from `Exceptions.kt`

## [2.0.3] - 2023-11-08

### Added
- `Synchronizer.getExistingDataDbFilePath` public API to check and provide file path to the existing data database 
  file or throws [InitializeException.MissingDatabaseException] if the database doesn't exist yet. See #1292.

### Changed
- `CompactBlockProcessor` switched internally from balance and progress FFIs to wallet summary FFI APIs. This change 
  brings a block synchronization speed up. No action is required on the client side. See #1282.
- Checkpoints update

## [2.0.2] - 2023-10-20

### Fixed
- Incorrect note deduplication in the `v_transactions` database view: This is a fix in the Rust layer. The amount 
  sent in the transaction was incorrectly reported even though the actual amount was correctly sent. Now, clients 
  should see the amount they expect to see.

### Changed
- Checkpoints update

## [2.0.1] - 2023-10-02

### Changed
- `PersistableWallet` API provides a new `endpoint` parameter of type `LightWalletEndpoint`, which could be used for 
  the Lightwalletd server customization. The new parameter is part of PersistableWallet persistence. The SDK handles 
  the persistence migration internally.
- The **1_000** Zatoshi fee proposed in ZIP-313 is deprecated now, so the minimum is **10_000** Zatoshi, defined in 
  ZIP-317—the `ZcashSdk.MINERS_FEE` now returns the correct value as described above. Note that the actual fee is 
  handled in a rust layer.
- Adopted the latest Bip39 library v1.0.6

## [2.0.0] - 2023-09-25

## [2.0.0-rc.4] - 2023-09-22

### Fixed
Transparent balance is now correctly updated after a shielding transaction is
created, instead of only once the transaction is mined.

## [2.0.0-rc.3] - 2023-09-21

### Fixed
The Kotlin layer of the SDK now correctly matches the Rust layer `PrevHashMismatch` exception with `ContinuityError` 
and triggers rewind action. 

## [2.0.0-rc.2] - 2023-09-20

### Changed
- Some of the `TransactionOverview` class parameters changed:
  - `id` was removed
  - `index` is nullable
  - `feePaid` is nullable
  - `blockTimeEpochSeconds` is nullable

### Removed
- Block heights are absolute, not relative. Thus, these two operations above the `BlockHeight` object were removed:
  - `plus(other: BlockHeight): BlockHeight`
  - `minus(other: BlockHeight): BlockHeight`

## [2.0.0-rc.1] - 2023-09-12

### Notable Changes

- `CompactBlockProcessor` now processes compact blocks from the lightwalletd
  server using the **Spend-before-Sync** algorithm, which allows scanning of
  wallet blocks to be performed in arbitrary order and optimized to make it
  possible to spend received notes without waiting for synchronization to be
  complete. This feature shortens the time until a wallet's spendable balance
  can be used.
- The block synchronization mechanism is additionally about one-third faster
  thanks to an optimized `CompactBlockProcessor.SYNC_BATCH_SIZE` (issue **#1206**).

### Removed
- `CompactBlockProcessor.ProcessorInfo.lastSyncHeight` no longer had a
  well-defined meaning after implementation of the **SpendBeforeSync**
  synchronization algorithm and has been removed.
  `CompactBlockProcessor.ProcessorInfo.overallSyncRange` provides related
  information.
- `CompactBlockProcessor.ProcessorInfo.isSyncing`. Use `Synchronizer.status` instead.
- `CompactBlockProcessor.ProcessorInfo.syncProgress`. Use `Synchronizer.progress` instead.
- `alsoClearBlockCache` parameter from rewind functions of `Synchronizer` and
  `CompactBlockProcessor`, as it has no effect on the current behaviour of
  these functions.
- Internally, we removed access to the shared block table from the Kotlin
  layer, which resulted in eliminating these APIs:
  - `SdkSynchronizer.findBlockHash()`
  - `SdkSynchronizer.findBlockHashAsHex()`

### Changed
- `CompactBlockProcessor.quickRewind()` and `CompactBlockProcessor.rewindToNearestHeight()`
  now might fail due to internal changes in getting scanned height. Thus, these
  functions now return `Boolean` results.
- `Synchronizer.new()` and `PersistableWallet` APIs require a new
  `walletInitMode` parameter of type `WalletInitMode`, which describes wallet
  initialization mode. See related function and sealed class documentation.

### Fixed
- `Synchronizer.getMemos()` now correctly returns a flow of strings for sent
  and received transactions. Issue **#1154**.
- `CompactBlockProcessor` now triggers transaction polling while block
  synchronization is in progress as expected. Clients will be notified shortly
  after every new transaction is discovered via `Synchronizer.transactions`
  API. Issue **#1170**.

## [1.21.0-beta01]

Note: This is the last _1.x_ version release. The upcoming version _2.0_ brings the **Spend-before-Sync** feature,
which speeds up discovering the wallet's spendable balance.

### Changed
- Updated dependencies:
   - Gradle 8.3
   - AGP 8.1.1
   - Kotlin 1.9.10
   - Coroutines 1.7.3
   - Compose
   - AndroidX
   - gRPC/Protobuf
   - etc.
- Checkpoints

## 1.20.0-beta01
- The SDK internally migrated from `BackendExt` rust backend extension functions to more type-safe `TypesafeBackend`.
- `Synchronizer.getMemos()` now internally handles expected `RuntimeException` from the rust layer and transforms it
  in an empty string.

## 1.19.0-beta01
### Changed
- Adopted the latest Bip39 version 1.0.5

### Fixed
- `TransactionOverview` object returned with `SdkSynchronizer.transactions` now contains a correct `TransactionState.
  Pending` in case of the transaction is mined,but not fully confirmed.
- When the SDK internally works with a recently created transaction there was a moment in which could the transaction
  causes the SDK to crash, because of its invalid mined height. Fixed now.

## 1.18.0-beta01
- Synchronizer's functions `getUnifiedAddress`, `getSaplingAddress`, `getTransparentAddress`, and `refreshUtxos` now
  do not provide `Account.DEFAULT` value for the account argument. As accounts are not fully supported by the SDK
  yet, the caller should explicitly set Account.DEFAULT as the account argument to keep the same behavior.
- Gradle 8.1.1
- AGP 8.0.2

## 1.17.0-beta01
- Transparent fund balances are now displayed almost immediately
- Synchronization of shielded balances and transaction history is about 30% faster
- Disk space usage is reduced by about 90%
- `Synchronizer.status` has been simplified by combining `DOWNLOADING`, `VALIDATING`, and `SCANNING` states into a single `SYNCING` state.
- `Synchronizer.progress` now returns `Flow<PercentDecimal>` instead of `Flow<Int>`. PercentDecimal is a type-safe model. Use `PercentDecimal.toPercentage()` to get a number within 0-100% scale.
- `Synchronizer.clearedTransactions` has been renamed to `Synchronizer.transactions` and includes sent, received, and pending transactions.  Synchronizer APIs for listing sent, received, and pending transactions have been removed.  Clients can determine whether a transaction is sent, received, or pending by filtering the `TransactionOverview` objects returned by `Synchronizer.transactions`
- `Synchronizer.send()` and `shieldFunds()` are now `suspend` functions with `Long` return values representing the ID of the newly created transaction.  Errors are reported by thrown exceptions.
 - `DerivationTool` is now an interface, rather than an `object`, which makes it easier to inject alternative implementations into tests.  To adapt to the new API, replace calls to `DerivationTool.methodName()` with `DerivationTool.getInstance().methodName()`.
 - `DerivationTool` methods are no longer suspending, which should make it easier to call them in various situations.  Obtaining a `DerivationTool` instance via `DerivationTool.getInstance()` frontloads the need for a suspending call.
 - `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedFullViewingKeys()` no longer has a default argument for `numberOfAccounts`.  Clients should now pass `DerivationTool.DEFAULT_NUMBER_OF_ACCOUNTS` as the value. Note that the SDK does not currently have proper support for multiple accounts.
 - The SDK's internals for connecting with librustzcash have been refactored to a separate Gradle module `backend-lib` (and therefore a separate artifact) which is a transitive dependency of the Zcash Android SDK.  SDK consumers that use Gradle dependency locks may notice this difference, but otherwise it should be mostly an invisible change.

## 1.16.0-beta01
(This version was only deployed as a snapshot and not released on Maven Central)
### Changed
 - The minimum supported version of Android is now API level 27.

## 1.15.0-beta01
### Changed
- A new package `sdk-incubator-lib` is now available as a public API.  This package contains experimental APIs that may be promoted to the SDK in the future.  The APIs in this package are not guaranteed to be stable, and may change at any time.
- `Synchronizer.refreshUtxos` now takes `Account` type as first parameter instead of transparent address of type
    `String`, and thus it downloads all UTXOs for the given account addresses. The Account object provides a default `0` index Account with `Account.DEFAULT`.

## 1.14.0-beta01
### Changed
 - The minimum supported version of Android is now API level 24.

## 1.13.0-beta01
### Changed
- The SDK's internal networking has been refactored to a separate Gradle module `lightwallet-client-lib` (and
  therefore a separate artifact) which is a transitive dependency of the Zcash Android SDK.
    - The `z.cash.ecc.android.sdk.model.LightWalletEndpoint` class has been moved to `co.electriccoin.lightwallet.client.model.LightWalletEndpoint`
    - The new networking module now provides a `LightWalletClient` for asynchronous calls.
    - Most unary calls respond with the new `Response` class and its subclasses. Streaming calls will be updated
      with the Response class later.
    - SDK clients should avoid using generated GRPC objects, as these are an internal implementation detail and are in process of being removed from the public API.  Any clients using GRPC objects will find these have been repackaged from `cash.z.wallet.sdk.rpc` to `cash.z.wallet.sdk.internal.rpc` to signal they are not a public API.

## 1.12.0-beta01
### Changed
 - `TransactionOverview`, `Transaction.Sent`, and `Transaction.Received` have `minedHeight` as a nullable field now.  This fixes a potential crash when fetching transactions when a transaction is in the mempool

## 1.11.0-beta01
### Added
- `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk`:
  - `Synchronizer.getUnifiedAddress`
  - `Synchronizer.getSaplingAddress`
  - `Synchronizer.isValidUnifiedAddr`
  - `Synchronizer.getMemos(TransactionOverview)`
  - `Synchronizer.getReceipients(TransactionOverview)`
- `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.model`:
  - `Account`
  - `FirstClassByteArray`
  - `PendingTransaction`
  - `Transaction`
  - `UnifiedSpendingKey`
- `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.tool`:
  - `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedSpendingKey`
  - `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedFullViewingKey`
  - `DerivationTool.deriveTransparentAccountPrivateKey`
  - `DerivationTool.deriveTransparentAddressFromAccountPrivateKey`
  - `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedAddress`
  - `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedFullViewingKeys`
  - `DerivationTool.validateUnifiedFullViewingKey`
    - Still unimplemented.
- `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.type`:
  - `AddressType.Unified`
  - `UnifiedFullViewingKey`, representing a Unified Full Viewing Key as specified in
    [ZIP 316](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0316#encoding-of-unified-full-incoming-viewing-keys).

### Changed
- The following methods now take or return `UnifiedFullViewingKey` instead of
  `UnifiedViewingKey`:
    - `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk`:
      - `Initializer.Config.addViewingKey`
      - `Initializer.Config.importWallet`
      - `Initializer.Config.newWallet`
      - `Initializer.Config.setViewingKeys`
- `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk`:
  - `Synchronizer.Companion.new` now takes many of the arguments previously passed to `Initializer`. In addition, an optional `seed` argument is required for first-time initialization or if `Synchronizer.new` throws an exception indicating that an internal migration requires the wallet seed.  (This second case will be true the first time existing clients upgrade to this new version of the SDK).
  - `Synchronizer.new()` now returns an instance that implements the `Closeable` interface.  `Synchronizer.stop()` is effectively renamed to `Synchronizer.close()`
  - `Synchronizer` ensures that multiple instances cannot be running concurrently with the same network and alias
  - `Synchronizer.sendToAddress` now takes a `UnifiedSpendingKey` instead of an encoded
    Sapling extended spending key, and the `fromAccountIndex` argument is now implicit in
    the `UnifiedSpendingKey`.
  - `Synchronizer.shieldFunds` now takes a `UnifiedSpendingKey` instead of separately
    encoded Sapling and transparent keys.
  - `Synchronizer` methods that previously took an `Int` for account index now take an `Account` object
  - `Synchronizer.sendToAddress()` and `Synchronizer.shieldFunds()` return flows that can now be collected multiple times.  Prior versions of the SDK had a bug that could submit transactions multiple times if the flow was collected more than once.
- Updated dependencies:
  - Kotlin 1.7.21
  - AndroidX
  - etc.
- Updated checkpoints

### Removed
- `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk`:
  - `Initializer` (use `Synchronizer.new` instead)
  - `Synchronizer.start()` - Synchronizer is now started automatically when constructing a new instance.
  - `Synchronizer.getAddress` (use `Synchronizer.getUnifiedAddress` instead).
  - `Synchronizer.getShieldedAddress` (use `Synchronizer.getSaplingAddress` instead)
  - `Synchronizer.cancel`
  - `Synchronizer.cancelSpend`
- `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.type.UnifiedViewingKey`
  - This type had a bug where the `extpub` field actually was storing a plain transparent
    public key, and not the extended public key as intended. This made it incompatible
    with ZIP 316.
- `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.tool`:
  - `DerivationTool.deriveSpendingKeys` (use `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedSpendingKey` instead)
  - `DerivationTool.deriveViewingKey` (use `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedFullViewingKey` instead)
  - `DerivationTool.deriveTransparentAddress` (use `Synchronizer.getLegacyTransparentAddress` instead).
  - `DerivationTool.deriveTransparentAddressFromPrivateKey` (use `Synchronizer.getLegacyTransparentAddress` instead).
  - `DerivationTool.deriveTransparentAddressFromPublicKey` (use `Synchronizer.getLegacyTransparentAddress` instead).
  - `DerivationTool.deriveTransparentSecretKey` (use `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedSpendingKey` instead).
  - `DerivationTool.deriveShieldedAddress`
  - `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedViewingKeys` (use `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedFullViewingKey` instead)
  - `DerivationTool.validateUnifiedViewingKey`
